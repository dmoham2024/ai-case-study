**Tempus** is a company that focuses on bringing data driven and AI enabled solutions to the healthcare industry (Tempus Labs). Specifically, the research started with helping cancer care. The company was founded in August, 2015 by Eric Lefkosky (Eric Lefloski). At the time his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, and during cancer treatment he felt that more data driven strategies were needed to influence better care in the healthcare space (Eric Lefloski). Ryan Fukushima was the first employee hired to tackle the challenge of integrating data and AI with the study of oncology (Crain’s Chicago Business). Currently, Tempus  has raised over 1.3 billion dollars and has currently raised 275 million dollars as of October 2022 (Keerthi). The company has received G2 series funding from the following investors: Baillie Gifford, Franklin Templeton, Google, Novo Holdings (Carron).
Data driven AI solution in healthcare is a broad mission. The company has many projects. To focus, the company is trying to bring precision medicine to the hands of physicians. In other words, they want to present specific solutions for patients based on medical data presented and the help of AI. The physician would use this data to make decisions on a patient’s disease. The company started with solutions in oncology, and now it has expanded into the field of neurology, psychiatry, cardiology, infectious disease, and genomics. In oncology the company has built a system where they can sequence your genes and based on the sequencing they can further detect tougher cancers making AI algorithms (Wade et al). Some AI algorithmic tests include tests such as HRD, DPYD, and TO tumor test. These are all tests that use AI algorithms to further detect tough to diagnose cancer (Tempus). Furthermore, the company has developed a clinical assistant based on generative AI to help physicians navigate a centralized system for all the clinical data and specifically the patent’s data. This generative AI interface is called Tempus One (Business Wire). This helps because the system can narrow down specific pieces of data that  physicians may need to see. Other projects to diversify include the study of pharmacogenomic for depression. Pharmacogenomic is the study of what drugs suit the patient best rather than giving patient drugs based on standard treatment. Tempus uses a real world data tool to detect what drug suits the patient best and the main work in psychiatry is for studies in depression(Real world data, Tempus). With the help of data and AI driven tools Tempus can actually give you a report on which drug suits you best. The main market for this technology is helping the physician with easier to read tests and data. As a result this also affects the patient positively. Tempus is a major disruptor compared to its competitors because it actually utilizes many lab tests such as genomic profiling and then amplifies its strength with AI enabled algorithms and then further organizes its electronic health records with the use of AI. Furthermore, Tempus has also expanded into different fields of study after focusing on oncology. Compared to other companies, Tempus is not focused on one aspect that most companies usually are, such as either genome profiling, AI use, or better electronic platform. Tempus has done a very good job integrating all three aspects and then has further incorporated established professionals in their team such as Dr. Jeniffer Doudna or Dr. Eric Topol (CNBC). Compared to their competitors they claim to have the largest library of clinical and molecular data which powers all their technology solutions (Marcos).
The company is considered to be in the health tech space. Particularly this company is in the AI and healthcare space. In the last 5-10 years we have seen healthcare focus on augmenting AI with a couple of factors. Those factors include automating the healthcare administrations, helping assist in diagnosis, sequencing genomic data, testing pharmacogenomics, and performing virtual clinical trial data (Yang et al). The mindset of utilizing AI has also improved the usage and organization of big data in electronic health records (Sabet et al). Tempus has focused on all the trends besides streamlining healthcare administration. Major companies also participating in this field are Google, Augmedix, Corti, Butterfly Network, and Arterys (Mesko). All these companies work on the same trends discussed, but have niched themselves in particular areas of study, whereas Tempus focused on all aspects particularly in oncology and then expanded into other fields. 
Major impact has been made in the field of oncology. The demand for genomic sequencing has increased and Tempus has improved on its sequencing techniques with the help of data and AI. Core metrics that we can measure are revenue and growth, patient acquisition, patient retention, and pharmaceutical or hospital partnership. In 2016 the company had 100 customers and performed 10,000 tests, and by 2022 the company had 1000 customers and performed 1 million tests (The Brand Hopper). Furthermore, he company had raised 210 million in revenue by 2022. The company's growth relies on the amount of data they can collect, and Tempus has collaborated with three major pharmaceutical companies. This includes Astrazenecka, Pfizer, and GSK (Landi). Tempus has made its name in the personalized medicine and oncology space. It has competitors such as Foundation Medicine, Guardant, Flatiron health (Guardant website) (Foundation medicine Website) (Faltiron Website). However, these companies have niched themselves into particular aspects of health for example they may be focused on particular tests or just genomic profiling. They have not had the expansive approach of utilizing data and influencing many different tests. Tempus has expanded its reach very far with hiring talent and collaborating with big companies to utilize data on a large and fast scale in the field.
CEO Eric Lefloski has mentioned that his company has focused more on the diagnostic portion of oncology rather than the therapeutic side of oncology. The company is doing injustice in this manner. First, the company has shown massive diagnostic capabilities and the main reason is due to the mass data they have collected. However, if the data has made such an impact in diagnostics then it can also make a major impact in therapeutics. That data can be used to produce more therapies and drugs much faster especially in a field like cancer where the mainstay of treatment is usually just surgery, radiation or chemotherapy (Vemula et al). All these therapies are considered in ways debilitating and tough therapies at times depending on the patient. The pharmaceutical industry has negative aspects to it, but patients need new drugs in the market and with the help of AI and data we can push drugs faster and more accurately with personalized solutions for patients. Tempus has already built a good reputation with companies and hospitals which is why delving into therapeutics can only help and not hurt them. If they are weary about their reputation then they can build a different company off Tempus and make an impact as a separate company. The resources they would need to utilize are already available. They have the data, AI capabilities, research team, and pharmaceutical partnerships. They would just have to make a team for therapeutic research and get into clinical trials to test their drugs. Tempus has shown a lot of growth in the past few years and it will continue to grow the next few years as well.
